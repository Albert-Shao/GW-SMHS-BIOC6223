# GW-SMHS-BIOC6223
Repository for BIOC-6223 Bioinformatics graduate students midterm project

## Purpose
1. Provide students the opportunity to expand their knowledge and learn an additional tool, GitHub: a free code sharing and publishing service where users can host open source projects. There is robust [help documentation](https://github.com/about) available on GitHub.

2. Facilitate support and feedback on midterm deliverables. As students are posting their BCOs, they will be receiving direct and actionable feedback in the form of [issues](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/issues). 

By the end of this project, students should feel comfortable utilizing GitHub as a means of issue resolution in a collaborative environment.
